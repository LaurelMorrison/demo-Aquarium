            <h3>Tank Tips</h3>
                  <div>
                        <ul>
                            <h4>Salinity Levels</h4>
                            <li>Most reef-building corals also require very saline (salty) water ranging from 32 to 42 parts per thousand.</li>
                            <li>The water must also be clear so that a maximum amount of light penetrates it.</li>
                            <li>Too high of salinity and the enzymes and protein synthesis in the bodies of inverts and fish don't work so well.</li>
                      </ul>
                 </div>

                 <div>
                        <ul>
                            <h4>Temperature Tips</h4>
                            <li>A good range is 76째 to 80째F (25째 to 27째C).</li>
                            <li>A few species need to be kept several degrees warmer, and some species require temperatures a few degrees cooler. </li>
                            <li>A thermometer is vital. A stick-on type enables you to check the temperature whenever you look at the aquarium.</li>
                        </ul>
                 </div>

                 <div>
                        <ul>
                            <h4>Tank Cleaning</h4>
                            <li>If you have a large, well established tank you should clean your tank on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.</li>
                            <li>A water change should be done to the keep the tank clean and the fish happy.</li>
                            <li>Depending on the type of filter you use for the tank, you may be able to get away with cleaning the tank once per month.</li>
                        </ul>
